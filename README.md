# Shares Review Data Analysis

## Installations
 - Numpy  # linear algebra
 - Pandas # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - yfinance # the api for the stock data source
 - datetime

 
No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## files 
 - README.md ( this readme files )
 - noteboot-myshares.ipynb ( the jupyther notebook file ) 

## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in how to create a first blog post using kaggle and connect it with github.

I was also interested in how to use yfinance api and how to get the data out of this stock data source.
The conducting exploratory data analysis using a Kaggle post (https://www.kaggle.com/code/marthinx/marthinx-shares) to better understand:
 - How can the yfinance api be used ?
 - How can the data be accessed?
 - How can I create simple plots with the data?
 - How can I analyse the stock data?

I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium in what is hopefully an engaging post which gives the reader insight into the questions posed. 

## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post 
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marthinx/marthinx-shares)

## Conclusion
with the library 'yfinance' you can get all the stock data that are needed. It is a great way to analyse a depot and to analyse shares.
