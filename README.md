# Shares Review Data Analysis

## Installations
 - Numpy  # linear algebra
 - Pandas # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - yfinance # the api for the stock data source
 - datetime

 
No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in how to create a first blog post using kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/code/marthinx/marthinx-shares/edit/run/134603365

I was also interested in how to use yfinance api and how to get the data out of this stock data source.
the n conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Wine Review dataset found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews) containing approximately 130k reviews from the [Wine Enthusiast](https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine) to better understand:
 - How can the yfinance api be used ?
 - How can the data be accessed?
 - How can I create simple plots with the data?
 - How can I analyse the stock data?

I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium in what is hopefully an engaging post which gives the reader insight into the questions posed. 

## File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

## Medium Blog Post 
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@stephanieirvine15/how-data-will-make-you-drink-wine-differently-c59d669831a1)
